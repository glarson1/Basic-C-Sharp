# Basic-C-Sharp
This repository will contain all of my basic C sharp projects done during my time at The Tech Academy

## Projects:
* [Car Insurance](https://github.com/glarson1/CarInsurance)
* [TwentyOne](https://github.com/glarson1/Basic-C-Sharp/tree/main/TwentyOne)

## Car Insurance
This project is a MVC web app that was created to somewhat reselmble a car insurance website. It takes in user input on policy information and calculates a quote based on buisness logic. The project incules an admin page to view all quotes issued.

## TwentyOne
This project was to create the game of Blackjack (or twentyone) as a console application. This helped me learn a lot of different components of C\# including exception handling and logic. The program understands the rules of the game for now but refinements are to come.
